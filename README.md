# DECO1800-RideSafe
Ridesafe is a Quiz website designed to teach international students about bicycle safety in Australia.
This project was completed as part of a team in the DECO1800 Web API course.
The brief was to create an engaging website that would get users to interact with a government API dataset of some form, or more specifically:
>In teams of 4-5, you will conceptualise and build a web-based interactive application incorporating open government datasets that creates values for a particular group of users. The application will present data available from various governments jurisdictions within Australia, including from council, state, territory, and the commonwealth. Teams should explore how data from one or more datasets could be presented, combined, visualised, explored in a meaningful way through an interactive
application.

>Teams will respond to one of several high level, open, creative problem statements. Within these problem statements, teams will be able to work on concepts that have interest to them. Teams are expected to adopt a user-centred design process in the development of their concepts.

The brief that our website was encapsulated in was "Inner City Transport", and we primarily used Brisbane City Council's "Bikeway Sections" dataset.

After submission, some main features I would like to change/improve:
In the future I would like to
1) Remove redundant files,
2) Remove redundant code and (improve?) comments,
3) Remove the 'assets' folder, merging the contents to be consistent with the rest of the web application, and
4) Make the website fully functional including:

    a) Base the Map bikeway sections display on the Shapefile API, not a hard-coded JSON file
    
    b) Generate questions from a larger list (and fix which questions are asked)
    
    c) Make answer descriptions to questions more relevant, and tailored to 1) each question, and 2) whether it's correct or not
    
    d) Improve the CSS of the question and answer pages for windows (seems to work well no mac but not win for some reason?)
    
    e) Other usability improvements to be added/noted once I have time and can document some reflections/learnings
    
All externally used code and images should be referenced by comments in the code. I will add a full reference list when I get a chance.
